## zEdzPic (the editor's pic)

a simple text editor with a picture toggle for instant (re-)inspiration

written in c/gtk+, and using glade for the ui/widget layout

### requirements
- gtk+-3.0+
- GNU Make
- pkg-config

### status (pre-alpha)
- ui renders, but basic functionality / workflow of an editor as yet unimplemented so it is totally useless
